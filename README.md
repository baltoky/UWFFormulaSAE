#### Please make sure to look at the _Projects_ tab!

### Current team:  

**Jarrod Resmondo** (*Computer and Electrical Engineering.*)  
**Cesar Santiago** (*Computer Science.*)  
**Josh Johnson** (*Mechanical Engineering.*)  
**Jordan Campbell** (*Computer Science.*)  
**Alan Ward** (*Computer Science.*)  
**Samuel Mills** (*Physics.*)   

   The initial files and rules of the competition are in the FSAE_Main folder, make sure to read those first.The current draft for the car will also be there. If you're not familiar with GitHub try and learn how it works because we intend to use it as our main workstation. I have added a few handy tutorials to the end of this file. Create an account and fork the project, more information about that is in the _forking_ tutorial. If you want to mess around with any part of the repo make sure to create your own branch of the ArgoA-master branch which is our current branch for the first itteration of the design.
	
   Also, let's try and keep the team small for now. I think new members would dissipate the designs of the project and slow progress down. If you meet someone that is interested in the project bring it to the group's attention and we can discuss the viability of a new member. Thank you all for participating in this project. We can do this!
	
   I understand that GitHub is really unfriendly to new users, We have all been there. Therefore to make things easier for everyone I have linked to some important guides to using this cloud storage/project management tool. If used properly it can become really powerful. I recomend that if you are using windows, to install the Desktop app. It doesn't take a significant amount of drive space and it is really convenient.
